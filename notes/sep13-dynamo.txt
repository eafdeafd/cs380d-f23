RECAP
=====
- Bayou, a highly available replicated storage system
- We talked about how Bayou replicates keys, and tentative and stable writes
- We talked about how it gossips the keys, and how it avoids getting keys it has already seen
- We talked about materializing the views, and what is on stable storage


Dynamo
======
- Highly available key-value store from Amazon
- Key ideas: quorums, versions, application-assisted conflict resolution
- Assumptions:
  - Provides ACID properties
  - SLA 99.9th percentile
- Key design points:
  - Incremental scalability
  - Symmetry
  - Decentralization
  - Heterogenity
- Key techniques:
  - Consistent hashing
  - vector clocks
  - sloppy quorum, hinted handoff
  - anti-entropy using merkle trees
  - gossip-based membership
- Consistent Hashing
  - Used to distribute keys to nodes
  - Hashes keys and nodes to points on a ring
  - Key is handled by first node clockwise on the ring
  - Dynamo creates multiple virtual nodes for each physical node
  - Virtual nodes are placed on the ring
  - This distributed load more, and accounts of different physical node capacities
- Vector clocks
  - All writes include vector clock information for conflict detection
- Quorums in Dynamo
  - Dynamo reads N replicas, return fastest R results
  - Dynamo writes to W replicas, the W successors on the ring
    - the W replicas are *not* chosen randomly
  - Dynamo does hinted handoff, if any of the W successors are down, Dynamo writes to next node on the ring and leaves a hint
